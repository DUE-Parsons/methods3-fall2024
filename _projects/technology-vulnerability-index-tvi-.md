The **Technology Vulnerability Index (TVI)** is a tool designed to evaluate and visualize the digital disparities and vulnerabilities across New York City's neighborhoods. As cities increasingly rely on digital infrastructure, gaps in broadband access, digital literacy, and technological resources disproportionately affect underserved communities. The TVI seeks to identify areas at higher risk of exclusion, exploitation, and inequity, guiding policymakers and stakeholders toward targeted interventions for digital equity.

*"The Census Bureau and NTIA gathered and analyzed federal data to identify and quantify the eight different “covered populations” defined by the Digital Equity Act of 2021, which overall have historically experienced lower rates of computer and internet use."*
This data is then used to understand who the Digital Equity Plan is for.

Using Census Bureau data, I created a cartographic representation of the percentage of populations per census tract covered by the Digital Equity Plan. See below:

I am utilizing the TVI to assess whether all populations are adequately covered by the Digital Equity Plan. 

**Methodology**
The data included in the index scoring was gathered from various sources, including public datasets and community reports. The variables used in the TVI scoring are shown in the following chart:

Variables not included in the index score, but used for reference are:
     - Race (White, Black, Asian, Hispanic or latino)
     - PCT covered by the Digital Equity Plan
     - Density of Surveillance Cameras per intersection per census tract
*This comparison can be seen in the online map linked at the bottom of this page*

The process of creating this map includes:
     - Data Gathering, Cleaning, and Joining
     - Normalization of each variable
     - Composite Score Calculation

During normalization, each variable was standardized on a 0–1 scale to ensure comparability. "Positive" indicators, though reflecting negative social implications (e.g., percentage of households with no internet), were normalized to reflect higher vulnerability. Conversely, "negative" indicators (e.g., density of Wi-Fi hotspots) were normalized to reflect lower vulnerability.

The normalized variables were then combined to calculate a composite TVI score for each neighborhood, with higher scores indicating greater vulnerability.


The Technology Vulnerability Index (TVI) reveals significant digital disparities across New York City, with vulnerable neighborhoods often having higher Black and Hispanic/Latino populations. While the Digital Equity Plan of 2021 addresses many vulnerable communities, critical gaps remain—particularly in areas such as Borough Park-Kensington, South Williamsburg, Sheepshead Bay, and Flatbush. By identifying these disparities through a composite score and detailed mapping, the TVI serves as a vital tool for policymakers to ensure equitable digital access and inclusion across all populations.
