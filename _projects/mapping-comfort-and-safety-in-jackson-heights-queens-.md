This project aims to map and visualize comfort and safety in Jackson Heights, Queens, a vibrant yet under-resourced neighborhood with a significant South Asian and immigrant population. By focusing on public spaces, amenities, and urban design, the project examines how land use, accessibility, and infrastructure influence residents' experiences and perceptions of safety and comfort.

Jackson Heights, Queens, is a diverse neighborhood that serves as a focal point for the South Asian community and other immigrant populations. The area is characterized by its mix of residential, commercial, and public spaces, which shape the comfort and safety of its urban environment. Jackson Heights faces challenges in urban design, including insufficient amenities, limited tree cover, and lack of  public spaces. These factors influence how residents and visitors experience the neighborhood, particularly in terms of accessibility, inclusivity, and community interaction.

This disparity has a significant impact on the daily lives of the area’s residents, a majority of whom are immigrants. Nearly 64% of Jackson Heights’ population is foreign-born, with a significant representation of South Asian, Hispanic, and other immigrant groups. Many residents are renters, and the median household income falls below the city average, underscoring the systemic inequalities that shape their lived experiences. Public spaces are critical to fostering a sense of belonging and community, particularly in neighborhoods like Jackson Heights, yet the area faces challenges due to insufficient investment in urban infrastructure.

*The Comfort Index*
It evaluates urban amenities like benches, water fountains, restrooms, trees, libraries, and privately owned public spaces (POPS) to compare Jackson Heights’ comfort level to other NYC neighborhoods. While the quantitative data highlights gaps—like limited tree coverage, restrooms, and seating—the index also incorporates community feedback to assess how residents perceive comfort.

While Jackson Heights has received a Comfort Index score of 6.08—a figure that, in comparison to many areas in New York City, might not seem particularly low—this numerical representation fails to capture the nuanced realities of the neighborhood, especially in spaces like Diversity Plaza. Despite the score suggesting a moderately comfortable urban environment, the lived experiences and perceptions of residents and visitors paint a contrasting picture.

*Land Use Analysis in Jackson Heights*

The land use patterns in Jackson Heights play a crucial role in shaping public comfort and safety. This analysis focuses on the interplay between residential, commercial, and public spaces, highlighting the factors that contribute to or detract from the quality of urban life.

*Zoning and Space Allocation*

Jackson Heights is a mixed-use neighborhood with a combination of residential zones, bustling commercial streets, and limited public open spaces. The main commercial corridors, such as 37th Avenue and Roosevelt Avenue, are hubs for retail, dining, and community interactions, drawing diverse groups of people. However, these areas often lack adequate seating, shade, and other amenities to support prolonged comfort.

Residential areas, on the other hand, are quieter but sometimes disconnected from public gathering spaces. Many residential streets feature limited tree cover and minimal public infrastructure, such as benches or water fountains, which could improve walkability and community engagement.

*Public and Private Spaces*

Public spaces in the neighborhood include parks, libraries, and sidewalks, which vary in their accessibility and inclusivity. However, privately owned public spaces (POPS), such as courtyards in commercial buildings, are less accessible to the community due to unclear guidelines or restricted hours. This privatization limits opportunities for organic social interactions.

*Connectivity and Accessibility*

The neighborhood benefits from proximity to major transit hubs, including subway stations and bus stops. However, the pedestrian experience is uneven, with a lack of consistent infrastructure like protected crosswalks and bike lanes, making navigation challenging, especially for vulnerable populations.

*Temporal Dynamics*

Land use in Jackson Heights changes dynamically throughout the day. Commercial areas are vibrant during business hours but may feel unsafe at night due to poor lighting and reduced foot traffic. Residential streets, though quieter, often lack activity, creating a sense of isolation after dark.

*Impact on Comfort and Safety*

The imbalance between commercial vibrancy and residential tranquility highlights the need for better integration of public spaces into the urban fabric. Increased investment in green spaces, shaded seating, and accessible amenities could significantly improve the overall comfort and safety for residents and visitors alike.

[The map](https://felt.com/map/Mapping-safety-and-comfort-UPPKALb5S9BCFJOtukQpLrC?loc=40.7478701,-73.8921111,18.6z&share=1), which highlights various interviews conducted around Jackson Heights, particularly in Diversity Plaza, provides insight into the perspectives of those who regularly use the space. These interviews reveal the specific shortcomings of the plaza as experienced by its users, painting a clearer picture of what the space truly lacks.

By comparing the qualitative feedback from community members with quantitative data, a striking disconnect emerges. While Jackson Heights may not rank poorly in the broader Comfort Index, the lived experiences of its residents and visitors suggest a different reality. The metrics alone fail to fully capture the challenges and frustrations faced by those who rely on spaces like Diversity Plaza, where issues such as inadequate amenities, poor maintenance, and limited accessibility significantly impact daily life.

This contrast underscores the importance of integrating qualitative insights with numerical data to gain a comprehensive understanding of how public spaces function. It highlights that even if Jackson Heights achieves a middling score in a citywide comparison, it falls short in meeting the expectations and needs of its community, emphasizing the need for more resident-centered approaches to urban design and planning.
