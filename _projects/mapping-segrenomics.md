Inspired by W.E.B Du Bois’ Visualization Black America, this project compares “the various conditions of Black life" (w), by visualizing the distribution of the Black population between New York City, New York and Atlanta, Georgia, as Du Bois did in his own work. I will also be using Lawrence T. Brown’s, The Black Butterfly, to further explore these themes and how they relate to what he coined ‘urban apartheid’- a term used to describe the segregation and systematic destruction of Black neighborhoods through redlining and racist zoning practices, environmental racism, underfunded education systems, decaying/lacking infrastructure and public space, over policing, etc.  Not only does urban apartheid decrease quality of living for lifelong residents, but happens simultaneously with rising rent/housing costs. While low-income residents and households need resources like school funding, access to public space, and improved living conditions, instead what's being put in place are new trendy businesses and shops that don't cater to the current demographic whatsoever. These new businesses drive up property taxes and rent costs, making it near impossible for lifelong residents to stay and prosper. 

The goal of this project is not only to illustrate present day ‘urban apartheid’ in 2 of the most well known cities in the United States, but to also ask the question: Do the spatial, social, and economic conditions of the Black population differ between northern and southern urban areas?
